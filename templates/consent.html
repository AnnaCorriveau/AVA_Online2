      <b>Protocol: Behavioral study to understand human cognition and attention</b> <br>
      <b>IRB Study Number: IRB19-1242</b>
  </p>
<br>
  <p style="color:black;">
    Welcome! You are invited to participate in a research study investigating human cognition and behavior. <br>
    The study intends to collect your responses as you complete different tasks and/or surveys.<br>
    
    To help you make an informed decision about whether or not you would like to participate, <br>
    this form provides information about the study’s purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. <br>
    Please take time to review the consent before starting the experiment. <br>
    If and when you are ready, click on “I consent and agree to participate in this research study”, <br>
    which indicates that you voluntarily accept to participate in the study. <br>
    If you have questions about the experiment in general, <br>
    you may contact the Cognition, Attention, and Brain Lab in University of Chicago Department of Psychology at cablab.uchicago@gmail.com. <br>
    If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, <br>
    you may contact Social & Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at University of Chicago at sbs-irb@uchicago.edu.<br>

      <b><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></b> <br>
      This study will help us understand how people pay attention.
  </p>

  <p style="color:white;">
     <br> <br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
      <b><u>What will I be doing today, and how long will it take?</u></b> <br>
      During this study, you will see visual stimuli (e.g., images, videos, words, shapes) <br>
      presented on a computer monitor, and/or hear sounds. <br>
      You will respond according to the task instructions. <br>
      You may also be asked to complete questionnaires. <br>
      The length of your participation will be as advertised by the experimenter, <br>
      and you will be compensated at the rate specified for this online study. <br>
      If you decide to withdraw, data collected up until the point of withdrawal may still be included in analysis.<br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:white;">
     <br> <br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
      <b><u>What are the potential benefits and risks? </u></b> <br>
      Taking part in this research study may not benefit you personally, <br>
      but we may learn new things that could help others.<br>
      Your participation in this study does not involve any risk to you beyond that of everyday life.<br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:white;">
      <br> <br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
      <b><u>Will my personal information remain confidential?</u></b> <br>
      The researchers will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way.<br>
      The survey is therefore anonymous. <br>
      However, your Prolific account is associated with an ID number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, <br>
      and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched.<br>
      For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles, <br>
      the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous.<br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:white;">
     <br> <br>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
      <b><u>How will you protect the information you collect about me, and how will that information be shared? </u></b> <br>
      All of your responses will be held in strict confidence. <br>
      Identifiable data will not be stored or shared with other colleagues or funding sources, <br>
      and only the de-identified data will be protected on a secure server.<br>
      De-identified information from this study may be used for future research studies or shared with other researchers or funding sources for future research without your additional informed consent.<br>
